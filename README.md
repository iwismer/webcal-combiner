**Rust-powered** app to read multiple webcals and combine them into a single webcal served via HTTP. My use case was wanting a single calendar for my son's multiple concurrent basketball teams. This allows all the calendars to be combined into one that can be subscribed to by e.g. Google Calendar, iCal, etc., but still add a prefix to each event so it's obvious which team it's for. Now multiple people can all subscribe to a single calendar once, and the calendars that supply the events can be changed or updated at any time, and the combined calendar never needs to be touched - it will automatically update.

> **Note**: This application was recently migrated from Python to Rust for significantly improved memory efficiency (~85-90% reduction). See [MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md) for details.

## Usage

1. Copy `config.json.example` to `config.json`  
:warning: If the calendar starts with `webcal://` you will need to change it to `https://`
1. Edit `config.json` to add a `name` and `url` for each webcal
1. Run service: `docker-compose up -d --build`
1. Test by going to http://localhost:8080/calendar

You should see the combined calendar output starting with `BEGIN:VCALENDAR` with all the events from each calendar, prefixed with the expected `name`. Host this on a public URL and you can subscribe to it from Google Calendar, etc:

You can check that the output is valid here: https://icalendar.org/validator.html

## New Features (Rust Version)

- **Optional Caching**: Set `ENABLE_CACHE=true` to enable 5-minute TTL caching
- **Secure Key Management**: Use `WEBCAL_KEY` environment variable instead of config.json
- **Parallel Fetching**: All calendars fetched concurrently for better performance
- **Better Logging**: Control verbosity with `RUST_LOG` (trace, debug, info, warn, error)

## NOTES

1. By default, calendars are re-downloaded on every request (no caching). Enable with `ENABLE_CACHE=true` if desired.
1. Google Calendar does not poll frequently, seems to be every ~12 hours or so, which is annoying when there's a change and you want it to show up

I also switched to use `icalendar` instead of `ics` after running into bugs in `ics` and seeing how to use `icalendar` in https://github.com/LukasForst/camerge which is also MIT.
